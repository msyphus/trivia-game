### Demo

### General
A trivia game built to teach business management and leadership principles.  People in management roles are usually extremely busy, so this is a short, fun way for them to develop strong leadership skills geared towards creating happy shareholders, employees, and customers.

There are seven questions that are displayed one at a time.  The user has 30 seconds to answer the question.  When a question is answered, a message is displayed stating if the answer is correct or incorrect.  If correct, an explanation displays to provide an elaboration on the principle and a reference for further reading.  After 10 seconds, the next question is displayed.  If incorrect, no elaboration is given and the next question is displayed after two seconds.  The user does not have to do anything to advance to the next question.  If no answer is provided within the 30 second time limit, it is counted as incorrect and the next question will display.  A count of how many questions are answered correctly and incorrectly is taken and displayed at the end of the quiz with a total percentage score.  The quiz may be retaken as many times as desired.  To prevent route memorization, both the questions *and* answers are randomized.
