# Business Management Trivia Game

### Demo
The game can be played [here.](https://msyphus.github.io/trivia-game/)

### General
A trivia game built to teach business management and leadership principles.  People in management roles are usually extremely busy, so this is a short, fun way for them to develop strong leadership skills geared towards creating happy shareholders, employees, and customers.

There are seven questions that are displayed one at a time.  The user has 30 seconds to answer the question.  When a question is answered, a message is displayed stating if the answer is correct or incorrect.  If correct, an explanation displays to provide an elaboration on the principle and a reference for further reading.  If incorrect, no elaboration is given.  A button appears to allow the user to advance to the next question when he/she is ready.  If no answer is provided within the 30 second time limit, it is counted as incorrect and the Next Question button will display.  A count of how many questions are answered correctly and incorrectly is taken and displayed at the end of the quiz with a total percentage score.  The quiz may be retaken as many times as desired.  To prevent route memorization, both the questions *and* answers are randomized.
