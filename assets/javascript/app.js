        correct: "Failure to create the right work culture",
        explain: "Correct! It is common to blame circumstances or people when failure occurs, but failure to create an appropriate work culture is a root \
                 problem that creates unfavorable circumstances.",

        answers: ["Complaints", "Compliments", "Saying everything is \"Just fine\"", "Silence"],
        correct: "Saying everything is \"Just fine\"",
        explain: "Correct! If customers tell you this, they either don\'t trust that you'll do anything about their feedback or they don't care to give it to you. \
                 Is it because they have already decided to go elsewhere? Is it because they are not loyal? You'll never know if you don't investigate!",

        correct: "Show the importance of what they do",
        explain: "Correct! If people don't understand the importance of what they do, they will not be motivated enough to excel in difficult conditions.  The other \
                 options are also important, but they have to be built on a foundation of understanding why the work being done is important.",

        correct: "No",
        explain: "Correct! Although this is a well-rounded approach for customer feedback, it does not consider leading indicators and the review interval is too long. \
                 By the time you know there's a problem, it's already too late!",

                 The challenge to being a good manager is to find the balance between the two.",
